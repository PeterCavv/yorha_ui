# YoRHa Vue.js

Welcome to the frontend of the YoRHa app proyect! Here you can see the UI of the app. 


## What is the YoRHa Proyect?

This proyect is mostly influenced by the game NieR: Automata, a game that take place in a distante future where humans are no longer alive, and androids (created by them) are protecting the Earth from the machines, who came from space. 

The proyect is like the management application of the androids organization called YoRHa.


## What can I do in this App?

The ultimate goal is to manage YoRHa's androids, creating new ones, assigning roles, etc. 
There're different android models you can create: YoRHa and Special models. This two have some differences from each other, like the Special ones doesn't have a type, and have their own name.


Only the operators and the administrator can operate the app.


Operators have other androids on their command and androids can only be created by the administrator.


## Proyect Status

This proyect is unfinished, being about 35% complete, there's still many implementations to be done.
If you want to take a look to the proyect, you're free to do so! You can also see how the development goes by accessing to [my workspace on Trello](https://trello.com/b/osxteix8/yorha) where I log all the tasks.
